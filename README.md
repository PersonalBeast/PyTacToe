# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the PyQT5 framework in Python. The game is designed to run on any platform that supports Python and PyQT5.

# Requirements
To play the game, you'll need to install Python 3.x and the PyQT5 library.

You can install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You can install PyQT5 using pip: pip install pyqt5

# How to Play
To play the game, simply run the TicTacToe.py file with Python: python TicTacToe.py 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty square on the grid. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# Development
